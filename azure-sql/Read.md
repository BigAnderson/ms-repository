# Azure Data SQL Samples Repository
This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to use Microsoft's Azure Data products including SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse, and Azure SQL Edge. Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.

Note that certain features like In-Memory OLTP are edition specific for SQL Server and would be possible to implement if the edition which supports that feature is being used to run the sample.
